STEPS USED AT KAIARU TO SOLVE THE SCHOOL PROBLEM

Summary of DS Steps for Problem-solving:

1. What business problem do you have to solve?

2. How can you solve the problem with the data? (Analytical)

3. Data needs. Which data do you need to solve the problem? 

4. Data collection. Identify where and how youâ€™ll get the data from.

5. Is your data collection relevant to the problem you want to solve?

6. Data preparation. What more do you need to do to manipulate and work with this data?

7. Modeling. To get the solution- in which ways can the data be visualized etc.? 

8. Evaluation. Did your model work in answering the questions and solving their problem? Or do you need to adjust it?

9. Deployment. Is the model ready for practice? 

10. Constructive Feedback. Negative feedback- If it needs adjustments iterate (by repeating relevant steps) until the problem is solved.
